	Long: `bldr usually works in buildkit frontend mode when it's not directly
exposed as a CLI tool. In that mode of operation bldr loads root Pkgfile and
a set of pkg.yamls, processes them, builds dependency graph and outputs it
as LLB graph to buildkit backend.

bldr can be also used to produce graph of dependencies between build steps and
output LLB directly which is useful for development or debugging.`,

// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
